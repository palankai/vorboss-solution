# Alice's Dashboard

The "service" is part of an interview exercise.

> Alice has recently started a business selling 3D printed jewellery for cats.
> As you would expect business is booming and Alice wants to keep track of the success of the business with a metrics dashboard.
> She is currently managing her orders in a spreasheet in Airtable, and would like to continue to be able to do so.
>
> She would like her dashboard to contain some key figures, such as:
> - Total Orders
> - Total Orders this month
> - Number of orders in progress
> - Revenue
> - A list of the most recent few orders
> ..and anything else that you think that she may find useful.
>
> You can use any stack that you like; at Vorboss we tend to favour Node + React.
> Remember, whilst this is an internal tool for Alice and doesn't need to win any design awards,
> you should take pride in the detail and keep in mind clean and maintainable code.
> For ease of developement and deployment, we would like the application to be conatinerised using Docker.
> Documentation for the Airtable API can be found online.
